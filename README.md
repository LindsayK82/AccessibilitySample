# Accessability Sample Page

## Description

-The motivation for this project was to provide a sample page showing accessibility options. I built this page to display the skills I have acquired to leap these hurdles. Adding accessibility features ensures ease of use for any user, and provides a welcoming experience.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

No installation steps are necessary at this time.

## Usage

The only usable portion of the site as it stands is the text to speech button. Simply type anything in the box and click the button.

In future development, the text box can be expanded. Additionally, a different text to speech software could be used. The current coding supports the JavaScript text to voice feature, but there are many API's available on the market to upgrade and further enhance the page.
